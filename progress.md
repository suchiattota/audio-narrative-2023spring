Started working on my project in audacity today. I have decided to work with audios that I can find online for today because recordings for my narrative 
require help of other people and that can only be done over the weekend. So, for today, I started my project by searching for audio files I need on 
Freesound, downloading them and adding them to audio_files folder, creating assets file and adding audios I am using as assets along with their source 
and creating a sources file and citing all the audios I have used along with the license that gives me the permission to use and edit them.

Today's work focused on the ending part of my audio narration. **Screenshot 1** in progress-screenshots.md shows my work by the end of today.
It starts from the car engine starting. After a bit of the car driving, I added a sound for a car indicator to indicate the car taking a turn and 
halting by pulling of the handbrake. After this is one of my favorites things I did today and also learned a lot from. Since it is milestone worth 
mentioning, I added **Screenshot 2** in progress-screenshots.md to show what exactly I am talking about. So, I was working with opening and closing of 
the car door and accidentally learned that I can move an audio and place it on the same track as another audio. This is so helpful because my project
has a lot of audios and placing audios that don't interact with other audios in an already existing track reduces clutter by reducing number of tracks I 
have in my project and allowing me to easily edit. Another feature I learned was the duplicate feature that allowed me to duplicate a whole track, 
different from copy and paste. So, I duplicated the car opening and closing track that includes two different audio files. I did this to show a really small
detail in my story. According to my story, two characters will be stepping out of the car, that means we would have to hear two sets of car doors opening 
and closing. I layered them such that the second door opens after the first. I also reduced the volume of the second car door opening and closing to show
that the other door is a little away from the first one. Continuing with the story, we move to walking and opening the car trunk. Since this part of the 
audio is in a forest setting, I included walking on dried leaves. Then we hear digging of the ground with a shovel, walking to the trunk, getting the 
dead body and dropping it in the hole hug (the audio for dropping the dead body is actually an audio for a bundle of ropes being dropped on ground).
Then we hear the shovel again as the characters cover up the hole. Then there is walking back to the car trunk and closing it (another small detail in the story, since only two charcaters are carrying the dead body, they would have left the trunk open, since this not a visual story, closing the trunk could be easily forgotten). As one of the characters meddles with the car keys, we hear police siren.

As I completed my editing for today and heard the audio a couple of times, I noticed I had to make some changes. One, the car drive seems really short, so 
I need make it longer by adding more engine sound. There is background noise in some of the places so I need to use noise removal. I still I need to add 
birds chirping and animal howl for the forest setting. 

Question I have now. Since I only worked with the ending of my narrative, I realized that I have no space in the beginning to add new audio as I started 
adding files from 0 seconds. Moving all the audios clips doesn't seem feasible since I spent a lot of time layering and aligning them. So is it possible 
to edit my ending narrative separately, convert it to mp3, and add it another audacity file that focuses on the beginning of my narrative.

Completed the first edit of the complete story today. Although it took hours to do so, it felt easier and faster to do as compared to the last time and that might have to do with the fact that I am more comfortable with using adacity now and didn't have to constantly refer to tutorials to complete certain tasks. 

Today's work involved adding bird's chirping and coyote howl to the ending part of my narration along with voices and verbal permissions to use them. I tried my best to fix distortion and remove unnecessary background noise, which was definitely challenging to do so. I took **Screenshot 3** as a comparison to **Screenshot 1**. Initially I had two tracks of digging, done the same way as opening and closing of car doors, where one track is lower in volume and pace to give the effect that the second voice is a little far away. Altough it was one of my favorite things to do, I had to remove it to match my narration as according to the story we only have one shovel. It is possible that no one would have realized this or are highly likely to overlook it, I wanted to ensure the story is ficitionally accurate. Following this, I converted the ending to a MP3 file and then created a new audacity project and worked with the beginning of the audio narrative. The beginning mostly has audio clips I have recorded. They were quite easy to work with initially but there is distortion in some places I haven't been able to get rid off. Once done, I added the ending MP3 to complete the story, shown in **Screenshot 4**. I ended my work with updating storyline.md to make it more accurate to match the edits I made in my audacity file.

Splitting my narrative into two audacity projects was definitely one of the best decisions because it made a lot of things easier for me. It also gave me the freedom to edit the beiginning and ending seperately, making my overall work faster and not having to deal with more than 20 tracks in a single project.
