Started working on my project in audacity today. I have decided to work with audios that I can find online for today because recordings for my narrative 
require help of other people and that can only be done over the weekend. So, for today, I started my project by searching for audio files I need on 
Freesound, downloading them and adding them to audio_files folder, creating assets file and adding audios I am using as assets along with their source 
and creating a sources file and citing all the audios I have used along with the license that gives me the permission to use and edit them.

Today's work focused on the ending part of my audio narration. **Screenshot 1** in progress-screenshots.md shows my work by the end of today.
It starts from the car engine starting. After a bit of the car driving, I added a sound for a car indicator to indicate the car taking a turn and 
halting by pulling of the handbrake. After this is one of my favorites things I did today and also learned a lot from. Since it is milestone worth 
mentioning, I added **Screenshot 2** in progress-screenshots.md to show what exactly I am talking about. So, I was working with opening and closing of 
the car door and accidentally learned that I can move an audio and place it on the same track as another audio. This is so helpful because my project
has a lot of audios and placing audios that don't interact with other audios in an already existing track reduces clutter by reducing number of tracks I 
have in my project and allowing me to easily edit. Another feature I learned was the duplicate feature that allowed me to duplicate a whole track, 
different from copy and paste. So, I duplicated the car opening and closing track that includes two different audio files. I did this to show a really small
detail in my story. According to my story, two characters will be stepping out of the car, that means we would have to hear two sets of car doors opening 
and closing. I layered them such that the second door opens after the first. I also reduced the volume of the second car door opening and closing to show
that the other door is a little away from the first one. Continuing with the story, we move to walking and opening the car trunk. Since this part of the 
audio is in a forest setting, I included walking on dried leaves. Then we hear digging of the ground with a shovel, walking to the trunk, getting the 
dead body and dropping it in the hole hug (the audio for dropping the dead body is actually an audio for a bundle of ropes being dropped on ground).
Then we hear the shovel again as the characters cover up the hole. Then there is walking back to the car trunk and closing it (another small detail in the story, since only two charcaters are carrying the dead body, they would have left the trunk open, since this not a visual story, closing the trunk could be easily forgotten). As one of the characters meddles with the car keys, we hear police siren.

As I completed my editing for today and heard the audio a couple of times, I noticed I had to make some changes. One, the car drive seems really short, so 
I need make it longer by adding more engine sound. There is background noise in some of the places so I need to use noise removal. I still I need to add 
birds chirping and animal howl for the forest setting. 

Question I have now. Since I only worked with the ending of my narrative, I realized that I have no space in the beginning to add new audio as I started 
adding files from 0 seconds. Moving all the audios clips doesn't seem feasible since I spent a lot of time layering and aligning them. So is it possible 
to edit my ending narrative separately, convert it to mp3, and add it another audacity file that focuses on the beginning of my narrative.

Completed the first edit of the complete story today. Although it took hours to do so, it felt easier and faster to do as compared to the last time and that might have to do with the fact that I am more comfortable with using adacity now and didn't have to constantly refer to tutorials to complete certain tasks. 

Today's work involved adding bird's chirping and coyote howl to the ending part of my narration along with voices and verbal permissions to use them. I tried my best to fix distortion and remove unnecessary background noise, which was definitely challenging to do so. I took **Screenshot 3** as a comparison to **Screenshot 1**. Initially I had two tracks of digging, done the same way as opening and closing of car doors, where one track is lower in volume and pace to give the effect that the second voice is a little far away. Altough it was one of my favorite things to do, I had to remove it to match my narration as according to the story we only have one shovel. It is possible that no one would have realized this or are highly likely to overlook it, I wanted to ensure the story is ficitionally accurate. Following this, I converted the ending to a MP3 file and then created a new audacity project and worked with the beginning of the audio narrative. The beginning mostly has audio clips I have recorded. They were quite easy to work with initially but there is distortion in some places I haven't been able to get rid off. Once done, I added the ending MP3 to complete the story, shown in **Screenshot 4**. I ended my work with updating storyline.md to make it more accurate to match the edits I made in my audacity file.

Splitting my narrative into two audacity projects was definitely one of the best decisions because it made a lot of things easier for me. It also gave me the freedom to edit the beiginning and ending seperately, making my overall work faster and not having to deal with more than 20 tracks in a single project.

### Reflection
My audio narrative project, titled “The Cover-up”, was a very exciting project and I enjoyed every step in the process of completing this project. “The Cover-up” follows the story of two friends burying their dead roommate in the woods. The audio begins after the murder takes place, so we don’t know who committed the murder. The dialogues for the voices of the two friends were carefully written such that one of them is loud and assertive and the other is quiet and nervous. This was done so the audience can interrupt who committed the murder themselves, it could have been that the assertive friend killed the roommate and has forced the quiet friend to help, or it could have been the quiet one that did the killing and goes into shock so the assertive one takes the responsibility of covering it up, or as my friend said, there could have been a third person all along who committed the murder and we hear their footsteps but they just haven’t spoken. The story is upto the interpretation of the audience and even the ending adds to this. The narration ends with the faint sound of the police siren slowly getting louder and one of the voices questioning nervously if it’s the cops and the audio abruptly ending leaving upto the audience to imagine what might have happened.

This story is something I am proud of because it pushed me out of my comfort zone to think of an interesting narration, especially considering my first idea was to do a simple day in the life. The story went through minor changes throughout the process of this project to match with the audios I found online and recorded myself, but the idea and goal of my narration remained and same since the beginning and I believe I did it justice.
The first hurdle I faced was finding suitable audio clips online. It was a time-consuming task to listen to multiple variations of a single audio, for example, the opening of a car door, and picking the best one. Most of my audio clips were obtained from freesound.org and the remaining were recorded by me. I also appropriately credited my audios from freesound.org along with their licenses that give me the permission to use them in the sources.md file. This fulfilled the baseline criteria of having at least one audio recorded by me and one I have permission to use and also crediting them.
The main challenges I faced with the project were working with audacity. It was very new to me, and my initial editing often involved following along to online tutorials. With practice I became comfortable with doing a lot of editing without having to search online how to accomplish a certain task. The main features I used throughout the project were amplify, to adjust audio volume levels, normalize, to remove distortion and background noise, fade-in and fade-out, to smoothly transition between audio clips, along with basic editing like cut, copy, paste, duplicate, and split. Something that I accidentally discovered was that I can place different audio clips on the same track, this allowed me to not scroll through too many tracks to find one audio clip that I had to align.

The final audio file in audacity looks like this. It has an audio length of 2:37 minutes, falling within the required 2-4 minutes in the baseline criteria.

You can notice the ending track being more than a minute long. This is because I split my audio narration into two files to make my work easier and not deal with too many tracks in a single file. The ending-draft.aup3 and ending-draft.mp3 are the audacity file and mp3 file of only the second part of my narrative. This portion includes only freesound.org audio clips and also the part of project that fulfills the baseline requirement of having three layers of sound overlap at least once.

Attached below is a portion of my audio. This is the moment where both the characters get out of the car. It was a milestone moment for me because I was proud of coming up with the idea and being able to implement it, thus worthy of mentioning in my reflection. It shows two car doors opening and closing to indicate two people getting out of the car. It also shows that one of the car doors opens later in time and has volume lower than the first door. This is to give a feel that the second door is farther away from the first.

A helpful portion of this project was receiving feedback from my peers. Elio listened to the second portion of the narrative and gave the following feedback.

**Screenshot 6**

Firstly, I was nervous about receiving feedback. Nowhere in my github repository have I mentioned what my audio narrative is about, so I was concerned if the audience would understand the story I was trying to tell but I was glad to hear Elio hear the story I am trying to narrate. One thing Elio mentioned was to pay attention to how loud each audio clip is and I couldn’t agree better. There were certain parts in my audio where the background sounds like the coyote howl was too loud and there were important parts like digging which was low in volume compared to the rest of the audio. I fixed these issues by using the amplify feature and adjusting volume of those specific parts.

Overall, this was a very exciting project and now I can proudly say I make comfortable with using audacity. I fulfilled all the baseline requirements as mentioned in this reflection along with having .mp3 file of the project in my repository and completing my work in pace with the deadlines. I met most of the aspirational criteria. The only three aspirational goals I didn’t meet were creating a sense of space, including synthesized sounds created by an automated process, and having more than three audio clips overlap. The reason for not fulfilling these requirements is simply that I didn’t need them for my narrative. I am happy how of my project has turned out.
